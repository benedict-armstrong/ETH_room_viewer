# ETH Rooms Tool

Application to find free Rooms at ETH ZÃ¼rich

hosted at https://eth.benarmstro.ng

The official <a href="http://www.rauminfo.ethz.ch/IndexPre.do">Rauminfo</a>
site isn't great so I built an alternative. The tool shows you all currently available rooms at ETH.
If you have any suggestions for improvements or questions send me an email. Feel free to fork the code and add features ðŸ‘¾.

## TODO

- update docker-compose file so it is easy to run locally on any machine
- 'add to home-screen' popup/message if on IOS/Android
- filter by proximity to current location
- add filters especially for room_type
- reporting rooms (locked, damaged equipment etc...)

### Start frontend locally:

```{bash}
cd frontend; npm run dev
```

### Start backend locally:

```{bash}
cd api; npm run dev
```
